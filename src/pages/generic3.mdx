## Burger King Foot Lettuce  
<hr/>

*Foot Lettuce*

Number 15, Burger king foot lettuce. <br/> The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. 
But as it turns out, that might be what you get. <br/>
A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. 
With the statement, This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King. 
Admittedly, he had shoes on. But that's even worse. <br/> 
The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. 
At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? <br/>
Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in **Mayfield Heights, Ohio.** 
This was at 11:47. <br/> Three minutes later at 11:50, the *Burger King branch address was posted* with wishes of happy unemployment. 
5 minutes later, the news station was *contacted* by another 4channer. <br/>
And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's "Tell us about us" online forum. 
The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. <br/>
Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. 
When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said **"Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired."<br/>
** Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.
